SIMPLE PYTHON API 

If you are aware of setting up a python app on cpanel, then this code will work on there.

So go ahead and use it to kinda get how it works.

It has a html page that has bootstrap so it looks good and you get an alert thats 

dissmisable. 

You need to also create a table with the correct columns. (check the insert query)

Basically go through the python code in the main.py file and see what I've indicated 

to change according to your exact situation.

Hope its not so hard :)

Let me know though, I'd be glad to help
